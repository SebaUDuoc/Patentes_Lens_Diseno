The behavior recognition algorithm in the complex environment based on WiFi data designed by the invention is effective and reliable, solves the problems that a traditional algorithm cannot extract multipath signals influenced by a human body and cannot fully utilize characteristics, and also solves the problem that a traditional cutting algorithm is poor in robustness; and the identification precision and the application potential of the system in various complex environments are improved by using the deep learning network.",UNIV CHONGQING POSTS & TELECOM,YANG XIAOLONG;;CAO RUOYU;;ZHOU MU;;XIE LIANGBO;;HE WEI;;WANG JIACHENG,,https://lens.org/014-025-142-418-701,Patent Application,no,16,4,2,2,0,H04B7/0626;;H04L25/022;;G06V40/20;;G06N3/045;;G06N3/044;;G06F2218/02;;Y02D30/70,G06K9/00;;G06N3/04;;H04B7/06;;H04L25/02,,2,0,,,"ZHENGJIE WANG等: ""A Survey on Human Behavior Recognition Using Channel State Information"", 《IEEE》;;周启臻等: ""基于连续图像深度学习的Wi-Fi人体行为识别方法"", 《通信学报》",ACTIVE

The allocation of fault may further be used to adjust risk levels or profiles associated with the autonomous or semi-autonomous operation features, which may be applied to other vehicles having the same or similar features.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,KONRARDY BLAKE;;CHRISTENSEN SCOTT T;;HAYWARD GREGORY;;FARRIS SCOTT,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2015-04-14),https://lens.org/112-938-465-756-675,Granted Patent,yes,968,17,4,69,0,G07C5/085;;G06Q40/08;;G06Q40/00;;G06Q40/08;;G07C5/08;;G07C5/085;;B60W50/0205;;G06Q40/00;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/0808,G06Q40/08;;B60W50/02;;G06Q40/00;;G07C5/00;;G07C5/08,,341,19,053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;033-988-082-910-403;;037-513-242-742-215;;149-261-986-805-939;;166-981-196-322-133;;043-790-215-470-560;;059-094-041-035-893;;053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;033-988-082-910-403;;103-294-521-335-270;;117-209-340-951-858;;030-969-017-968-120;;073-400-323-490-296;;018-125-227-317-989;;037-661-967-484-721;;166-981-196-322-133;;096-814-235-852-458,10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1109/isda.2008.358;;10.1145/375735.376310;;10.1109/itsc.2012.6338904;;20819826;;10.1098/rsta.2010.0110;;10.1109/iros.2010.5651993;;10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1109/dasc.2002.1052941;;10.1007/978-3-662-45854-9_5;;10.1080/00423110600563338;;10.1016/j.trc.2012.10.003;;10.1109/green.2010.5453797;;10.1109/acc.2012.6315654;;10.1109/itsc.2012.6338904;;10.1109/inftech.2008.4621607,"Franke, Uwe & Gavrila, Dariu & Gorzig, Steffen & Lindner, Frank & Paetzold, Frank & Wohler, Christian, Autonomous Driving Goes Downtown., Nov. 1998,  IEEE Intelligent System, 1-13 (Year: 1998).;;U.S. Appl.
