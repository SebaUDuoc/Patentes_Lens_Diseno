At least some of the identified transaction types and measured audit parameters corresponding to the transactions are recorded. A gamification module associates the measured audit parameters with game parameters. Motivational imagery such as a scoreboard is generated for display.,ORACLE INT CORP,JAVED LAL MOHAMMED AMEERJAN SHOAIB;;RODGERS MICHAEL PATRICK;;LEAHY-DIOS FILIPE;;GRIESHABER GARY TAFT;;BALI GURBINDER SINGH;;LUKEZ RUDOLPH E,ORACLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (2015-08-27),https://lens.org/031-142-367-369-655,Granted Patent,yes,7,0,4,4,0,A63F13/30;;A63F13/30;;A63F13/35;;A63F13/35;;A63F13/85;;A63F13/85;;G06F3/048;;G06F3/048,A63F9/24;;A63F13/30;;A63F13/35;;A63F13/85;;G06F3/048,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
